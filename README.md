# [L1: Loopy Graphics with C-Turtle](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yMQGsJwNXTUsabYNo_k56b9-Jwk1EKFaGgM8e2fVt2c/edit?usp=sharing)

### Author:
- Author of this program: *Luke Wilson*
- Author of the [C-Turtle](https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle) library: Jesse Walker-Schadler

## Use C-Turtle to create something that makes you happy!
-  Creativity is encouraged and will be rewarded.
-  A-level work will demonstrate excellent effort!
-  Be sure you use looping and one or more conditinals!

### Starter files have been provided for you in C++

1. **REASON FOR ART CHOICE**
*Why did this particular art appeal to you and make you happy?*

*I like this art because of the visual effect it gives and how it changes shades of color.*

2. **The Sun and the Whirlpool** 
*Name your work of art and explain why you chose this name.*

*I chose this name because it describes what is drawn in the program*

3. **C-Turtle METHODS** 
*How much difficulty did you have figuring out how to use the C-Turtle library? Did your knowledge of the Python Turtle library help?*

*It was mostly easy with a few slip ups here and there*

4. **C-Turtle USABILITY**
*Was there anything that you tried that did not work? Explain.*

*When I tried assigning colors to the turle it wouldn't work. The only color that worked was red. The goto method wasn't working for some reason, maybe I did something wrong.
I also tried creating my own turtle shapes with gifs but the HEAD_LESS library wouldn't work. I tied importing randrange but gave up because
I wasn't sure how to do it correctly'*

5. **PROCESS SUMMARY**
*Briefly summarize your design and implementation process, 
including how much your initial design plan evolved, 
the final results you achieved, and the amount of time you spent 
as a programmer or programmers in accomplishing these results. 
This should be one or at most two paragraphs.*

*I spent a lot of time thinking about this project. About a whole day on what I'd draw and how I'd draw it. I wasn't sure if I should draw a picture like a car or dog. I decided to draw
some cool patterns instead. It was mostly me just experimenting and seeing what the craziest thing I could draw. I found out that numbers can be associated with color so I made the screen changed with the i
in my loops to give a cool fade in and out affect. I also did this with the turtles as well. I made sure to ask for input from the user because their
input would affect what is drawn. I made sure to make comments and organize my code. Overall this took about 3-4 days'*

6. **DESIGN CHALLENGES**
*Describe the primary conceptual challenges that you encountered 
in trying to complete this lab and what might have made the 
lab easier for you.*

*I originally wanted to make a cool animation with gifs by changing the shape of my turtle but that proved to be too hard. I also
could get the circle method to work. I think it's broken. So I think the most challenging thing was not knowing how to do certain things
or know certain methods. I look through Jessie's github repository but I couldn't find any fixes for some of the things that 
puzzled me. I think learning some the methods and what to import would have worked'*

7. **ERRORS**
*List in bulleted form of all known errors 
and deficiencies with a very brief explanation.*

- *I think everything is working but I'd say if you messed with the indention of my code it would mess it up'*

8. **LEARNING AND REACTION**
*A paragraph or so of your own comments 
on what you learned and your reactions to this lab.*

*I learned that numbers can be associated with colors in the c-turtle library. I learned more about loops and how i can be very 
useful. I learned that looking at an author's repository is very handy. I really liked drawing with turtles in this lab because 
it made me think creativley which code which will help me in my future career. I also liked experimenting with code
by using incremental testing*

9. **INTEGRITY STATEMENT**
*Please briefly describe ALL help you received and 
all help you gave to others in completing this lab.
Also list all other references below.*

*I mostly used Jesse's original code with the if statements because I'm still learning to use {} all the time.*
